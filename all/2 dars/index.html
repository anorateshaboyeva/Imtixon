        <h3 style=text-align:center;color:brown;">Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h1>
        <h>TO LEON WERTH</h>
            <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
            <h4>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY </h4>

          <hr>

            <h1  style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="01"></a>I</h1>
<p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>
<img src="hroznys.jpg" alt="">
<p>In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."

    I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</p>
<img src="rasimmm.jpg" alt="">

</h1>
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
<div>
    <img src="raaasss.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p>
    The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.

In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.

Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:

"That is a hat."

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.

<h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="02"></a>II</h1>

<p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I 
had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something 
was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, 
I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life 
or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</p>

<p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any 
human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the 
middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened 
by an odd little voice. It said:</p>

<p><em>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</em></p>

<p><em>"What!"</em></p>

<p><em>"Draw me a sheep!"</em></p>

<p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked 
carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood 
there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, 
later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming 
than its model.</p>

<img src="rassss.jpg" alt="">

<p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's 
career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas 
from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>

<p>Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my 
head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from 
any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly 
among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing 
about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand 
miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>

<p><em>"But--what are you doing here?"</em></p>

<p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of 
great consequence:</p>

<p><em>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</em></p>

<p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might 
seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I 
took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered 
how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, 
and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. 
He answered me:</p>

<p><em>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</em></p>

<p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had 
drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded 
to hear the little fellow greet it with:</p>

<p><em>"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor 
is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, 
everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."</em></p>

<p>So then I made a drawing.</p>

<img src="img.jpg" alt="">


<p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>

<p><em>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</em></p>

<p>So I made another drawing.</p>

<img src="Beran.jpg" alt="">


<p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>

<p><em>"You see yourself,"</em> he said, <em>"that this is not a sheep. This is 
a ram. It has horns."</em></p>

<p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>

<p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>

<p><em>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</em></p>

<img src="staryBeranek.jpg" alt="">


<p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking 
my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</p>

<img src="imges.jpg" alt="">


<p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>

<p><em>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</em></p>

<p>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:</p>

<p><em>"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have 
to have a great deal of grass?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Why?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</em></p>

<p><em>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small 
sheep that I have given you."</em></p>

<p>He bent his head over the drawing.</p>

<p><em>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..."</em></p>

<p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</p>

<hr>
<h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="03"></a>III</h1>

<p>
    It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.

The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
</p>
<img src="princSala.jpg" alt="">
<p><em>"What is that object?"</em></p>

<p><em>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."</em></p>

<p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>

<p>He cried out, then:</p>

<p><em>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Yes,"</em> I answered, modestly.</p>

<p><em>"Oh! That is funny!"</em></p>

<p>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me 
very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Then he added:</p>

<p><em>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</em></p>

<p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; 
and I demanded, abruptly:</p>

<p><em>"Do you come from another planet?"</em></p>

<p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from 
my plane:</p>

<p><em>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."</em></p>

<p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out 
of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.</p>

<p>You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the
<em>"other planets."</em> I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on 
this subject.</p>

<p><em>"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which 
you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</em></p>

<p>After a reflective silence he answered:</p>

<p><em>"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night 
he can use it as his house."</em></p>

<p><em>"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you 
can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</em></p>

<p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p>

<img src="malyPrincHvezdy.jpg" alt="">

<p><em>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</em></p>

<p><em>"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get 
lost."</em></p>

<p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p>

<p><em>"But where do you think he would go?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."</em></p>

<p>Then the little prince said, earnestly:</p>

<p><em>"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"</em></p>

<p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>

<p><em>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."</em></p>

<hr>
<h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="04"></a>IV</h1>

<p>I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet 
the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!</p>

<p>But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to 
the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given 
names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has 
a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one 
of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example,
<em>"Asteroid 325"</em>.</p>

<p>I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince 
came is the asteroid known as B-612.</p>

<p>This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish 
astronomer, in 1909.</p>

<img src="pozorovatelHvezdy.jpg" alt="">


<p>On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International 
Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, 
and so nobody would believe what he said.</p>

<p>Grown-ups are like that...</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator 
made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. 
So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive 
style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.</p>

<img src="matematikStary.jpg" alt="">


<p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number 
for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that 
you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. 
They never say to you, <em>"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love 
best? Does he collect butterflies?"</em> Instead, they demand: <em>"How old is he? 
How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father 
make?"</em> Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about 
him.</p>

<p>If you were to say to the grown-ups: <em>"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy 
brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,"</em> they would not 
be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: <em>
"I saw a house that cost $20,000."</em> Then they would exclaim: <em>"Oh, what a 
pretty house that is!"</em></p>

<p>Just so, you might say to them: <em>"The proof that the little prince existed 
is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If 
anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists."</em> And what good would 
it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a 
child. But if you said to them: <em>"The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,"</em> 
then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.</p>

<img src="matematikNovy.jpg" alt="">

<p>They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always 
show great forbearance toward grown-up people.</p>

<p>But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. 
I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should 
have like to say: <em>"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a 
planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."</em></p>

<p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth 
to my story.</p>

<p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much 
grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend 
went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make 
sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had 
a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer 
interested in anything but figures...</p>

<p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. 
It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures 
except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from 
the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true 
to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along 
all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, 
in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. 
And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best 
I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p>

<p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something 
that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, 
perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through 
the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow 
old.</p>

<hr>
<h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="05"></a>V</h1>

<p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's 
    planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, 
    as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on 
    the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.</p>
    
    <p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince 
    asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt--<em>"It is true, isn't it, that 
    sheep eat little bushes?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Yes, that is true."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Ah! I am glad!"</em></p>
    
    <p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. 
    But the little prince added:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?"</em></p>
    
    <p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, 
    on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd 
    of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.</p>
    
    <p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p>
    
    <p><em>"We would have to put them one on top of the other,"</em> he said.</p>

    <img src="sloni.jpg" alt="">

    <p>But he made a wise comment:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><em>"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat 
    the little baobabs?"</em></p>
    
    <p>He answered me at once, <em>"Oh, come, come!"</em>, as if he were speaking of 
    something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort 
    to solve this problem, without any assistance.</p>
    
    <p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as 
    on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds 
    from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep 
    deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with 
    the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly 
    at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If 
    it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow 
    wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon 
    as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</p>
    
<img src="uklid.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little 
    prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested 
    with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if 
    you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through 
    it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, 
    they split it in pieces...</p>
    
    <p><em>"It is a question of discipline,"</em> the little prince said to me later 
    on. <em>"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to 
    attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see 
    to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when 
    they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in 
    their earliest youth. It is very tedious work,"</em> the little prince added,
    <em>"but very easy."</em></p>
    
    <p>And one day he said to me: <em>"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that 
    the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very 
    useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,"</em> he added, <em>"there 
    is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter 
    of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited 
    by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."</em></p>
    
    <p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. 
    I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs 
    is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who 
    might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve.
    <em>"Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"</em></p>
    
    <p>My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without 
    ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. 
    The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.</p>

    
<img src="baobaby.jpg" alt="">


    <p>Perhaps you will ask me, <em>"Why are there no other drawing in this book as 
    magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"</em></p>
    <p>Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little 
    life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure 
    of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth 
    day, when you said to me:</p>
    
    <p><em>"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><em>"But we must wait,"</em> I said.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Wait? For what?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"For the sunset. We must wait until it is time."</em></p>
    
    <p>At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. 
    You said to me:</p>
    
    <p><em>"I am always thinking that I am at home!"</em></p>
    
    <p>Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is 
    setting over France.</p>
    
    <p>If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, 
    right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny 
    planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can 
    see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...</p>
    
    <p><em>"One day,"</em> you said to me, <em>"I saw the sunset forty-four times!"</em></p>
    
    <p>And a little later you added:</p>
    
    <p><em>"You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Were you so sad, then?"</em> I asked, <em>"on the day of the forty-four 
    sunsets?"</em></p>
    
    <p>But the little prince made no reply.</p>
    <img src="zapadSlunce.jpg" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="07"></a>VII</h1>
    
    <p>On the fifth day--again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep--the secret of 
    the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead 
    up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on 
    his problem, he demanded:</p>
    
    <p><em>"A sheep--if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"A sheep,"</em> I answered, <em>"eats anything it finds in its reach."</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><em>"Even flowers that have thorns?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Yes, even flowers that have thorns."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Then the thorns--what use are they?"</em></p>
    
    <p>I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that 
    had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to 
    me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water 
    left that I had to fear for the worst.</p>
    
    <p><em>"The thorns--what use are they?"</em></p>
    
    <p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, 
    I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my 
    head:</p>
    
    <p><em>"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"</em>
    </p>
    
    <p><em>"Oh!"</em></p>
    
    <p>There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at 
    me, with a kind of resentfulness:</p>
    
    <p><em>"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#271;ve. They reassure 
    themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."</em></p>
    
    <p>I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: <em>"If this bolt still 
    won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer."</em> Again the little prince 
    disturbed my thoughts:</p>
    
    <p><em>"And you actually believe that the flowers--"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Oh, no!"</em> I cried. <em>"No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered 
    you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see--I am very busy with 
    matters of consequence!"</em></p>
    
    <p>He stared at me, thunderstruck.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Matters of consequence!"</em></p>
    
    <p>He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, 
    bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...</p>
    
    <p><em>"You talk just like the grown-ups!"</em></p>
    
    <p>That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:</p>
    
    <p><em>"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."</em></p>
    
    <p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p>
    
    <p><em>"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never 
    smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He 
    has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over 
    and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes 
    him swell up with pride. But he is not a man--he is a mushroom!"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"A what?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"A mushroom!"</em></p>
    
    <p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p>
    
    <p><em>"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions 
    of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of 
    consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns 
    which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers 
    not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's 
    sums? And if I know--I, myself--one flower which is unique in the world, which grows 
    nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite 
    some morning, without even noticing what he is doing--Oh! You think that is not 
    important!"</em></p>
    
    <p>His face turned from white to red as he continued:</p>
    
    <p><em>"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all 
    the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look 
    at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there...' But if the 
    sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think 
    that is not important!"</em></p>
    
    <p>He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.</p>
    
    <p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now 
    was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, 
    the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and 
    rocked him. I said to him:</p>
    
    <p><em>"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for 
    your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--"</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know 
    how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him 
    once more.</p>
    
    <p>It is such a secret place, the land of tears.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="08"></a>VIII</h1>
    
    <p>I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the 
    flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took 
    up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear 
    in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from 
    a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince 
    had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small 
    sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.</p>
    
    <p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The 
    little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once 
    that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was 
    not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her 
    green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself 
    slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the 
    world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her 
    beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her 
    mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.</p>
    
    <p>Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.</p>

    <img src="kvetinaPrinc.jpg" alt="">


    <p>And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still 
    all disarranged..."</em></p>
    
    <p>But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Oh! How beautiful you are!"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Am I not?"</em> the flower responded, sweetly. <em>"And I was born at the 
    same moment as the sun..."</em></p>
    
    <p>The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest--but 
    how moving--and exciting--she was!</p>
    
    <p><em>"I think it is time for breakfast,"</em> she added an instant later. <em>
    "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--"</em></p>
    
<img src="zalevani.jpg" alt="">

    <p>And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can 
    of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.</p>
    
    <p>So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was, if 
    the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when 
    she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Let the tigers come with their claws!"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"There are no tigers on my planet,"</em> the little prince objected. <em>
    "And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"I am not a weed,"</em> the flower replied, sweetly.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Please excuse me..."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"I am not at all afraid of tigers,"</em> she went on, <em>"but I have a horror 
    of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant,"</em> remarked the little 
    prince, and added to himself, <em>"This flower is a very complex creature..."</em></p>

    <img src="vitr.jpg" alt="">


    <p><em>"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where 
    you live. In the place I came from--"</em></p>
    
    <p>But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. 
    She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let 
    herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#271;ve untruth, she coughed two or three 
    times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.</p>
    
    <p><em>"The screen?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."</em></p>
    
    <p>Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse 
    just the same.</p>
    
    <p>So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from 
    his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without 
    importance, and it made him very unhappy.</p>
    
    <p><em>"I ought not to have listened to her,"</em> he confided to me one day.
    <em>"One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and 
    breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to 
    take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, 
    should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."</em></p>

    <img src="selma.jpg" alt="">

    <p>And he continued his confidences:</p>
    
    <p><em>"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have 
    judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. 
    I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection 
    that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was 
    too young to know how to love her..."</em></p>


<img src="ochrana.jpg" alt="">
    <hr>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="09"></a>IX</h1>
    
    <p>I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of 
    wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. 
    He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; 
    and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also 
    had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, <em>"One never knows!"</em> So 
    he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes 
    burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires 
    in a chimney.</p>
    
    <p>On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That 
    is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.</p>
    
    <p>The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last 
    little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But 
    on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when 
    he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter 
    of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said to the flower.</p>
    
    <p>But she made no answer.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Goodbye,"</em> he said again.</p>
    
    <p>The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.</p>
    
    <p><em>"I have been silly,"</em> she said to him, at last. <em>"I ask your forgiveness. 
    Try to be happy..."</em></p>
    
    <p>He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, 
    the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Of course I love you,"</em> the flower said to him. <em>"It is my fault 
    that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you--you 
    have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... Let the glass globe be. I don't 
    want it any more."</em></p>

    <img src="ochrana (1).jpg" alt="">
    <p><em>"But the wind--"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"My cold is not so bad as all that... The cool night air will do me good. 
    I am a flower."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"But the animals--"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish 
    to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. 
    And if not the butterflies--and the caterpillars--who will call upon me? You will 
    be far away... As for the large animals--I am not at all afraid of any of them. 
    I have my claws."</em></p>
    
    <p>And, na&#271;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:</p>
    
    <p><em>"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"</em></p>
    
    <p>For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.</p>
    
    <hr>
    <h1  style="text-align:center;color: brown;"><a name="10"></a>X</h1>
    
    <p>He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 
    and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he 
    was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.</p>

    <img src="zima.jpg" alt="">

    <p><em>"Ah! Here is a subject,"</em> exclaimed the king, when he saw the little 
    prince coming.</p>
    
    <p>And the little prince asked himself:</p>
    
    <p><em>"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"</em></p>
    
    <p>He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Approach, so that I may see you better,"</em> said the king, who felt consumingly 
    proud of being at last a king over somebody.</p>
    
    <p>The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire 
    planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained 
    standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.</p>
    
    <p><em>"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,"</em> the 
    monarch said to him. <em>"I forbid you to do so."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"I can't help it. I can't stop myself,"</em> replied the little prince, thoroughly 
    embarrassed. <em>"I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Ah, then,"</em> the king said. <em>"I order you to yawn. It is years since 
    I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn 
    again! It is an order."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..."</em> murmured the little prince, 
    now completely abashed.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Hum! Hum!"</em> replied the king. <em>"Then I--I order you sometimes to 
    yawn and sometimes to--"</em></p>
    
    <p>He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.</p>
    
    <p>For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be 
    respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because 
    he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.</p>
    
    <p><em>"If I ordered a general,"</em> he would say, by way of example, <em>"if I 
    ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not 
    obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"May I sit down?"</em> came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
    </p>
    
    <p><em>"I order you to do so,"</em> the king answered him, and majestically gathered 
    in a fold of his ermine mantle.</p>
    
    <p>But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this 
    king really rule?</p>
    
    <p><em>"Sire,"</em> he said to him, <em>"I beg that you will excuse my asking you 
    a question--"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"I order you to ask me a question,"</em> the king hastened to assure him.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Sire--over what do you rule?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Over everything,"</em> said the king, with magnificent simplicity.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Over everything?"</em></p>
    
    <p>The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all 
    the stars.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Over all that?"</em> asked the little prince.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Over all that,"</em> the king answered.</p>
    
    <p>For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.</p>
    
    <p><em>"And the stars obey you?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Certainly they do,"</em> the king said. <em>"They obey instantly. I do not 
    permit insubordination."</em></p>
    
    <p>Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master 
    of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four 
    times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, 
    without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered 
    his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king 
    a favor:</p>
    
    <p><em>"I should like to see a sunset... Do me that kindness... Order the sun to 
    set..."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, 
    or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general 
    did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the 
    wrong?"</em> the king demanded. <em>"The general, or myself?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"You,"</em> said the little prince firmly.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform,"</em> 
    the king went on. <em>"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered 
    your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. 
    I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Then my sunset?"</em> the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot 
    a question once he had asked it.</p>
    
    <p><em>"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science 
    of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"When will that be?"</em> inquired the little prince.</p>
    
    <p><em>"Hum! Hum!"</em> replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted 
    a bulky almanac. <em>"Hum! Hum! That will be about--about--that will be this evening 
    about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"</em></p>
    
    <p>The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he 
    was already beginning to be a little bored.</p>
    
    <p><em>"I have nothing more to do here,"</em> he said to the king. <em>"So I shall 
    set out on my way again."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Do not go,"</em> said the king, who was very proud of having a subject.
    <em>"Do not go. I will make you a Minister!"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Minister of what?"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Minster of--of Justice!"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"But there is nobody here to judge!"</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"We do not know that,"</em> the king said to him. <em>"I have not yet made 
    a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. 
    And it tires me to walk."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Oh, but I have looked already!"</em> said the little prince, turning around 
    to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, 
    there was nobody at all...</p>
    
    <p><em>"Then you shall judge yourself,"</em> the king answered. <em>"that is the 
    most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to 
    judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a 
    man of true wisdom."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Yes,"</em> said the little prince, <em>"but I can judge myself anywhere. 
    I do not need to live on this planet."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"Hum! Hum!"</em> said the king. <em>"I have good reason to believe that somewhere 
    on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. 
    From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your 
    justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. 
    He is the only one we have."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"I,"</em> replied the little prince, <em>"do not like to condemn anyone to 
    death. And now I think I will go on my way."</em></p>
    
    <p><em>"No,"</em> said the king.</p>
    
    <p>But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had 
    no wish to grieve the old monarch.</p>
    
    <p><em>"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,"</em> he said, <em>"he should 
    be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order 
    me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable..."</em></p>
    
    <p>As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with 
    a sigh, he took his leave.</p>
    
    <p><em>"I make you my Ambassador,"</em> the king called out, hastily.</p>
    
    <p>He had a magnificent air of authority.</p>
    
    <p><em>"The grown-ups are very strange,"</em> the little prince said to himself, 
    as he continued on his journey.</p>
